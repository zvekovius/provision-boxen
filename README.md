# Provision Boxen
A repository meant to take an Ubuntu image from fresh to usable pretty quick.

# Getting Started
`cd /tmp/`

`sudo apt install git`

`git clone https://github.com/zvekovius/provision-boxen`

`cd /tmp/provision-boxen`

`./bootstraph.sh`

You should then have a boxen restarted ready for usage.
